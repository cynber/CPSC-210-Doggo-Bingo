# My Personal Project

## A Custom Bingo Game

#### What will the application do?

This application will let users generate custom bingo boards to then play by themselves or against friends. Users 
will be able to create custom "boards" with a list of items they want to include. The application will then generate 
a board with around 24<sup>1</sup> of those items for players to play with. The player can then mark off items on 
the board and save their progress to a file. The player can also export an image of the board to share with others. 



#### Who will use it?

This will be a desktop based game that can be used by anyone that wants either to make a custom bingo board or to 
track their progress on a board. Currently, it will only be a Java desktop application, but it may someday be ported 
to mobile devices (ex. Android).



#### Why is this project of interest to you?

This application is based off an idea for a "Dog Spotting Bingo" game I thought of with a friend. We thought it 
would be an entertaining way to keep in touch throughout the school year. In the original design, we made an image 
board, and we would update the board using the image editing "pen" tool in messaging apps. When someone would "spot" 
a dog, they would send a photo to the other person and mark off that breed on the board. Eventually it became 
difficult to find the latest board in our chat and the image lost quality after repeated copying. 

Eventually with the pandemic it became harder to keep in touch with others when we weren't able to see each other 
in-person. This game, or variations of it, may be a good way for others to also keep in touch with their friends and 
family. It creates a shared activity for the players to complete together, and it can be adapted for a variety of 
settings. 

After reading through the project requirements for my CPSC 210 personal project, I remembered this game idea and 
felt that it would be a good way to demonstrate the skills presented in the requirements. Users would be able to 
create lists of an arbitrary size with which they can build the boards. Users could then use the boards with a 
graphical interface.

**Gameplay Examples**
- Item Spotting Boards
  - **Solo Play:** Player will make a list of things<sup>2</sup> that they hope to spot. The player wins when they 
    have spotted enough items based on the game type<sup>3</sup>.
  - **Competitive Play:** Players will work together to generate a list of things that they hope to spot. Boards 
    will be generated from the same source and a player wins when they have spotted enough items based on the game 
    type<sup>3</sup>. Depending on the settings, all players may have the same set of selected items, or they may 
    have a random set of items from the full list.


- Prediction Based Boards
  - **Solo Play:** Player will make a list of events<sup>4</sup> that they predict will occur within a certain time 
    frame. The player wins when they have spotted enough items based on the game type<sup>3</sup>.
  - **Competitive Play:** Players will individually make lists of events<sup>4</sup> that they predict will occur 
    within a certain time frame. The player wins when they have spotted enough items based on the game type<sup>3</sup>.

<sup>1</sup> - The number of items that get used on the board will depend on the type of gameplay and the selected 
grid size.

<sup>2</sup> - A few "Item Spotting Board" examples include:
- Spotting different breeds of dogs (ex. Pomeranian, Chihuahua, Dachshund, Great Dane, Samoyed, etc.)
- Exploring and spotting local flora (ex. Local trees, such as Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Sitka Spruce, etc.) 
- Exploring and spotting local fauna (ex. Red squirrels, Douglas squirrels, Rufous Hummingbird, Glaucous-winged Gull,
  etc.)
- Spotting the makes / models / colors of vehicles driving by on the highway or past a certain location

<sup>3</sup> - Example games include basic BINGO rules (completing a row, column or diagonal) or blackout BINGO 
(completing the entire board).

<sup>4</sup> - A few "Prediction Based Board" examples include:
- Events that will occur during an election (ex. Party X will win electoral district Y, candidate P will be 
  nominated for Q, etc.)
- Events that will occur during the Olympics or during a sports season (ex. Canada will win gold in 'Ice Hockey', 
  Canada will win gold in 'Freestyle skiing', a player from team T will be injured during the World Cup, etc.)
- Events that will occur during a movie, TV show episode, etc. (ex. Character A won't survive, Character B will say 
  a specific phrase, character C will end up with character D, etc.)
- Events that will occur during a family reunion (play this in front of your family members at your own risk...)
